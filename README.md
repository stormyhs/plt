# Project Leet
A hacker themed browser game.

## Contributing guidelines
Before pushing your shit code, please make sure to fufill the following points:

- !!! YOU TESTED YOUR CODE FULLY !!!
- You are not pushing waste files (such as `node_modules`, or config files). I left a `.gitignore` in the repo for this. Edit as needed.
- Your commits are modular, and the messages are descriptive. Consider squashing.
- You are pushing to a seperate, well named branch. Example: `networking_tab`, `signup_fix`.

## Last notes
If you know of someone who wants to join the project, tell stormy.

Don't leak the code. Not that it's anything special, just not cool.
